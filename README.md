# TMBuddy

See and manipulate exclusions from Time Machine backup, right in Finder.

## Installation

1. Get the app

2. Launch the app and follow the checklist, so that the all red lights:
   ![Checklist-Red.png](.Images/Checklist-Red.png)
   turn into green:
   ![Checklist-Green.png](.Images/Checklist-Green.png)

When selecting folders for the application, typically you want to navigate to Computer and select all the disks for which you want to employ TMBuddy:

## What works

- Shows exclusion status for every item on the system disk (if you see the caution icon ⚠️ by the item, it means that the item is for sure not backed up):

## TODO

- Speedup lookups

- Add support for managing exclusion from backup via contextual menu command
